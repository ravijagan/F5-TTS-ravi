example.sh has the default way of running F5. you need a voice sample and a text file what the voice is saying. it must be 15 secs . The long book to be transcribed must be of short sentences. Only 50 words. There is a cap on both the sample+the sentence to be less than 30 seconds. 

Activate virtual env 
see F5 github how to pip install all the packages. 
then run example.sh
So what did we change in F5 ? nothing major. the infer_cli.py can be modified to make life easier for us instead of using `cat the_stuff_that_should_have_been_in_file` . Then there are issues in preparing the machine wher GPU is not used. we can add debug statements in it. 
==================
3/16 542pm pst . cant get virtual env to pick up the GPU forgot what we did last time 
maybe used powershell ? maybe not 
seems to work now. Bleeds a little if the reference . have to fix it
