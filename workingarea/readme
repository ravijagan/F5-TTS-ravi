The prompt example.sh has the default way of running F5. you need a voice sample and a text file what the voice is saying. it must be 15 secs preferably 12 seconds. 
The long text to be transcribed must be of short sentences. sentences of Only 20 words. There is a cap on both the sample+the sentence to be less than 30 seconds. 

installation 
Activate virtual env 
see F5 github how to pip install all the packages. 
then run example.sh


So what did we change in F5 ? nothing major. the infer_cli.py can be modified to make life easier for us instead of using `cat the_stuff_that_should_have_been_in_file` . Then there are issues in preparing the machine wher GPU is not used. we can add debug statements in it. 

cant get virtual env to pick up the GPU ? this is the fix 


Start from scratch
create a venv
start bash <=====================================default cygwind does something
source ./f5venev_r/Scripts/activate <=================default sygwin does something else . Do not do bin/activate

The prompt must change to the environment name f5venv_r after activation

pip install -e . <========================================takes a long time to build f5-tts and its packages 10 mins 

Still no cuda? 
Go to cuda stite use the UI tool and change the settingsd so that  generates a pip command like this 
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
uninstall the above and reinstall 2.5GB takes a bit of time 

known issues 
works fine now with some bleed of training sentence .
