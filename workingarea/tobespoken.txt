in 2014, came the news that Manjul Bhargava, an Indian-origin mathematician had won the Fields Medal . This is often called the Nobel Prize of Mathematics. In an interview, he said his grandfather was a Sanskrit professor in Jaipur.  hes grandfather visited every summer, thus, he grew up learning the age-old works of Pingala, Hemachandra, and Brahmagupta in Sanskrit. The rhythms of their poetic mathematical and scientific treatises had inspired him to discover new ways of working out problems. When he saw that Gauss’ famous 18th-century composition law on binary quadratic forms took twenty pages to prove. he wanted to make it simple and elegant like the ancient Indian mathematicians did. He hit upon a way of combining Brahmagupta’s theorems with the Rubik’s cube to write the solution of the problem in just a few lines!
